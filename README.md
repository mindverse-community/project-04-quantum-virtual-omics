# 🧬 Quantum Virtual Omics (QVO)

**Quantum Virtual Omics (QVO)** is a next-generation whole-cell modeling framework that represents the living cell as a **quantum graph**, where:

- 📍 **Nodes** = discrete biological **events** (e.g., transcription bursts, calcium spikes, chromatin remodeling)
- 🔗 **Edges** = **phase relationships** that encode coherence, delay, or interference
- 🎼 **Pathways** = emergent **harmonic modes** of the quantum graph
- 🧠 **Cellular health** = defined by **synchronization and phase coherence**
- 🚨 **Disease and dysfunction** = modeled as **decoherence, bifurcation, or harmonic collapse**

---

## 📐 Project Objectives

- Simulate the evolution of a **quantum event wavefunction** over a biological graph
- Construct and monitor a **Health State Tensor (MST)** representing cellular state
- Explore **phase transitions**, **pathway resonance**, and **attractor landscapes**
- Build a modular, extensible architecture for future integration with real omics data

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `EventNode` | Represents a biological event as a complex-valued quantum node |
| `PhaseEdge` | Encodes phase lag and coherence strength between two events |
| `QuantumGraph` | Connects nodes and drives state evolution via a Hamiltonian |
| `Ψ(t)` | The wavefunction of the cell over event space |
| `MST(t)` | Multi-dimensional tensor monitoring cellular health and phase dynamics |
| `Attractors` | Stable harmonic modes corresponding to cell states (homeostasis, apoptosis, senescence, etc.) |
